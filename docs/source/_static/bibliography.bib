	abstract = {Efforts to computationally characterize large numbers of nanoporous materials often rely on databases of experimentally resolved crystal structures. The accuracy of experimental crystal structures used in such calculations has a significant impact on the reliability of the results. In this work, we report structures optimized using periodic density functional theory (DFT) for more than 800 experimentally synthesized metal{\textendash}organic frameworks (MOFs). Many MOFs changed significantly upon structural optimization, particularly materials that were crystallographically resolved in their solvated form. For each MOF, we simulated the adsorption of CH4 and CO2 using grand canonical Monte Carlo both before and after DFT optimization. The DFT optimization has a large impact on simulated gas adsorption in some cases. For example, CO2 loading at 1 bar changed by more than 25\% in over 25\% of the MOFs we considered.},

	abstract = {In this work, a computation-ready, experimental covalent organic framework (CoRE COF) database that nearly covers all the existing COFs was constructed and provided, which contains 187 COFs with disorder-free and solvent-free structures. Using the CoRE COF database established, structure-property relationships of COFs for Kr/Ar, Xe/Kr and Rn/Xe separations were studied. The conditions of industrial vacuum (VSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes were considered in the computation. Qualitative rules of COFs for noble gas separations were clarified, and structural features of COFs with excellent separation performance were summarized and suggested. In addition, COFs with good separation performance were identified from our database for industrial cyclic process. The knowledge obtained in this work may give guidance for experimental efforts in seeking advanced materials for noble gas separation, and the CoRE COF database will facilitate the fundamental research of COFs as well as the development of novel functional materials toward practical applications.},
